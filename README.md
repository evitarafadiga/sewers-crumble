> Survival horror game gender-neutral inclusive.   

![Caldo de Esgoto (Sewer's Crumble) Sneak Peek 1](sneakpeek_1.gif)
The Sewer's Crumble (Caldo de Esgoto in portuguese) is an isometric pixel-art game based on the horrors of a post apocalyptical society and auto-acceptance issues. It was made entirely by me except by the musical theme "LIXO" made by the multi-talented [![raivosier on twitter]raivosier](https://twitter.com/raivosier "raivosier on Twitter").

What makes the project such different is the fact that the storytelling is gender-neutral and terrifying, yet expected to fit to any kind of both players and cultures.
