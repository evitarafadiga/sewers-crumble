## Story üï≥Ô∏è
![Caldo de Esgoto (Sewer's Crumble) Sneak Peek 1](./images/sneakpeek_1.gif)
The Sewer's Crumble (Caldo de Esgoto in portuguese) is an isometric pixel-art about the modern horrors of a post apocalyptical society based on an allusion to auto-acceptance issues. It was made entirely by me except by the music theme "big croc type beat" made by the multi-talented [–≤‡πÄœÜ ¬¢—è‡πè¬¢](https://soundcloud.com/big_croc "listen to big croc on soundcloud").

## Inspiration ‚ù§Ô∏è
What makes the project special is the fact that the storytelling is both gender-neutral inclusive and tantalizing terrifying, as so expected to fit to any kind of both players and cultures.

## Trivia ‚õ≥Ô∏è
![Rose Concept Art](https://i.imgur.com/lRCf3pY.png)
At first we had Rose, a young gardener with the head full of rosebuds whom is fully inspired by the promo images of Halsey & Marshmello. Such vibrant colors sorted in some inspiration to me and designing characters. Then we have Miguel, retired detective and actually Rose's job partner that have a brotherhood relationship based on a great friend of mine who I still play RPG to and finally Ashly (close to Halsey's actual name Ashley), a strong sewer cleaner inspired by this beautiful person in a blue jumpsuit holdin beer cans.

As you can see, I collected years of references from other games, pop culture and even actual history events, like Neil Gaiman's Sandman, [The Greak Stink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Stink), the latest war as the world burns and nuclear war once more feels like a truly possibility, we could hide in sewer tunnels, seeking for hope. Like [Colin Joyce](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/poppy-i-disagree/) once punctuated "chaos can be cleansing, that calamity is the first step to starting all over again and building something new."
